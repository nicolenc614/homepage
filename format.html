    <h2>Formatting Text</h2>
    <h3>Paragraphs and Line breaks</h3>
    <p>
        Uses of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them control over the way that a page is displayed.\
        It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a means of marking up the structure of a document not as a\
        way of determning its presentation. Formatting text to appear on a Web page is therefore different from\
        formatting text to appear as a printed document.
