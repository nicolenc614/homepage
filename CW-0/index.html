Uses of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them control over the way that a page is displayed.\
It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a means of marking up the structure of a document not as a\
way of determning its presentation. Formatting text to appear on a Web page is therefore different from\
formatting text to appear as a printed document.
